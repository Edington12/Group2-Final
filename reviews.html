" SecondHand Helpers raised money for my twins surgery in just a week! Forest and River both have congential heart disease and the surgery almost cost my family an arm and a leg. Since being laid off due to the pandemic I simply just couldn't foot that bill. I am forever grateful to the staff at SecondHand Helpers that goes above and beyond for the families outside of the program. It is one thing to ensure my boys are learning but it is another thing to assist in their health expenses."

" When I say life savers is an understatememt to the good SecondHand Helpers does and did for my daughter. Shannon has always had a hard time being by herself. But ever since bringing her to SecondHand Helpers she now asks to have her SecondHand Helper pals come over. I am so excited to see what else is in store for her."

" Not only has SecondHand Helper brought a new meaning to the word "help" but SecondHand Helpers is a big help to the community by offering tutoring assistance on the weekend. I know it because of those extra days Daya is passing Math class now with flying colors! She actually wants to do her homework. I am lost for words at progress report because I never thought I'd see the day where she is getting A's all across the board."

  "Justin couldn't stay out the principal's office to save his life. Then one of his teachers at school suggested SecondHand Helpers said " They will steer him in the right direction." Me being the doubtful parent I am raised one eyebrow but gave it a shot. Not even three months later my son hasn't had a call from the school in months about his behavior. My son is more respectful towards his father and I. Justin is even being more helpful around the house! I couldn't have asked for better results."
