I can proudly say not only has Johnathan improved behavior wise but he actually begs us to go to the program on weekends!Thank you SecondHand Helpers because of you I have hope again."

" Thanks to SecondHand Helpers my Ayana is finally reading out loud and proud. Ayana is a nervous nelly when she is put on the spot. But no more does my little girl hide behind her book when called on."

" SecondHand Helpers raised money for my twins surgery in just a week! Forest and River both have congential heart disease and the surgery almost cost my family an arm and a leg. Since being laid off due to the pandemic I simply just couldn't foot that bill. I am forever grateful to the staff at SecondHand Helpers that goes above and beyond for the families outside of the program. It is one thing to ensure my boys are learning but it is another thing to assist in their health expenses."
